                    This calculator will help you determine if the investment property you're looking at is priced correctly and is worth investing in. Plug in the asking price, gross rents, and financing information, and we'll calculate cap rate, cash-on-cash return, gross rent multiplier (GRM), and internal rate of return (IRR) for you. Then, adjust your inputs (including the offer price) as you change your assumptions to see if the property is a worthwhile purchase.

                    It's hard to give a specific "buy" or "no buy" recommendation since everyone has different thresholds of risk. However, the outputs of this calculator will give you the information you need to make an educated determination.
                    We've designed this calculator for beginners, so we'll explain everything as we go â€” including the inputs and outputs.
